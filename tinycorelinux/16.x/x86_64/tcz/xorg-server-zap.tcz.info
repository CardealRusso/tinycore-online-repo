Comments:     Before loading this TCE check
                your current xorg settings by
                $ setxkbmap -query # you may need to keep a record?  

                2d=Xorg-7.7.tcz 3d=Xorg-7.7-3d.tcz  neither has a 
                zap feature. Zap means kill. If you are unable to use 
                exittc to exit to prompt, this TCE uses keyboard keys -- 
                to achieve the same effect.
                Ctrl + Alt + Backspace

                Expect to return to the console prompt.
                To regain Xorg desktop run $ startx.

                This TCE will fail if you do not have at least Xorg-7.7-bin 
                loaded which is achieved by loading 2d or 3d TCEs as above.  
                So no dep set.

                Due to my configs, install script will attempt to 
                make a read-write config file 
                /usr/local/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf
                If you need to change any setting, ensure you add 
                that file to your backup please. If your backup file over reboot, 
                is working correctly, you do not need this TCE in your 
                boot list. To persist the file ensure you add
                usr/local/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf  to backup file
                /opt/.filetool.lst

                Otherwise, best to have this TCE named higher in your boot 
                list than the 2d or 3d TCEs.  Boot list load from top to bottom
