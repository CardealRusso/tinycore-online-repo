Comments:       Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and
                understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.
                Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and 
                foster a data-driven culture:
                - **Visualizations:** Fast and flexible client side graphs with
                a multitude of options. Panel plugins offer many different
                ways to visualize metrics and logs.
                - **Dynamic Dashboards:** Create dynamic & reusable
                dashboards with template variables that appear as 
                dropdowns at the top of the dashboard.
                - **Explore Metrics:** Explore your data through ad-hoc
                queries and dynamic drilldown. Split view and compare
                different time ranges, queries and data sources side by side.
                - **Explore Logs:** Experience the magic of switching from
                metrics to logs with preserved label filters. Quickly search
                through all your logs or streaming them live.
                - **Alerting:** Visually define alert rules for your most
                important metrics. Grafana will continuously evaluate and
                send notifications to systems like Slack, PagerDuty,
                VictorOps, OpsGenie.
                - **Mixed Data Sources:** Mix different data sources in the
                same graph! You can specify a data source on a per-query
                basis. This works for even custom datasources.
