Comments:       Dillo is a multi-platform graphical web browser known
                for speed and small footprint, written in C and C++,
                based on FLTK (Fast Light Toolkit).
                Project objectives:
                - The democratization of internet information access
                - Personal security and privacy
                - High software efficiency
                Note:
                - First run creates /home/tc/.dillo directory
                - Copy /usr/local/etc/dillo/dillorc to /home/tc/.dillo
                  and modify as desired
                - Click ? top right corner of browser for usage help
                - Minimalistic, best suited for slow hardware
                - Supports only plain HTML/XHTML with CSS rendering
                  and images over HTTP, scripting is ignored
