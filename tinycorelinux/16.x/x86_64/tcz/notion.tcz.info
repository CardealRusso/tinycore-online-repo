Comments:       Do NOT use Apps "OnBoot" pulldown until you know how to use this WM.
 
                Supports autostarted software in ~/.X.d but all of them
                cover up the welcome page until you close them.
                
                Supports workspaces but no window decorations to use mouse kills
                Most GUIs allow Ctrl+q to quit eg l3afpad, pcmanfm but
                lxterminal uses  Ctrl+Shift+q. Otherwise use context menu to quit app.
                For a right hand mouse user - context menu is the right button 
               
                Static means you can manually resize frames.

                Windows logo key=mod4=META  
                F2 will start lxterminal ditto logo+Enter

                 logo+x kills active frame, you start with 2 frames.
                Each frame can have multiple tabs. If you kill all frames
                accidently -> logo+F9 starts afresh.
                F11 may maximise current client (software) but only inside frame size
                If you plan to use firefox please kill one frame as F11 is also a firefox
                keybinding which interferes if you have more than one frame open

                logo+j --- starts inbuilt run command similar to flrun
                -----use TAB key to autocomplete when sufficient letters input
                Executing F2, logo+Enter or a run command creates a TAB in 
                current frame.
                Use mouse to focus frame or logo+TAB to cycle thru frames

                F12 main menu  = logo+m
                A combined welcome and man page is displayed on launch
                but it difficult to read instead run $ man notion 
    
               F12 and select looks to change theme. Bottom panel prompts to save 
               changes....input y to save. Check ~/.notion files 
               LUA users may want to copy files from /usr/local/etc/notion to ~/.notion
               If so also read $ man notionflux

               On my AMD APU I needed Xorg YMMV. I tested on a single monitor.
               Wayland not supported. ssh untested by me. Inbuilt man page displays 
               poorly with groff so TCE contains normal man pages so run
               $ man notion

               If you are in trouble try F3 input=exittc select shutdown or try
               logo+Enter  input=exittcheck.sh and press enter
               Experienced users can delete tce.installed/desktop and reload it 
               then startx


               Optional TCE  
               dmenu if you are unable to increase font size for inbuilt  launcher
               notion-doc is a removable as inbuilt man viewer uses groff and is "unreadable" IMHO            
               
Change-log:     2025/03/18 v 4.0.3 on 16x, inbuilt man page needs groff not man-db for welcome page
Current:        2025/03/18
