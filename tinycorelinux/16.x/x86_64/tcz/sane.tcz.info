Comments:       For scanners and some cameras
                You must read http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html
                and heed any damage warnings. Then read the doc TCE
                and heed warnings about danger of running as root.
                But I tested as local user.
               
                scanimage is the frontend see $ man scanimage
                sane-find-scanner  -- useful if no scanner founds
                see /usr/local/etc/sane.d/brand.conf
                They are read only

                saned is the network daemon see $ man saned 
                & /usr/local/etc/sane.d/saned.conf (read only)

                example (I needed no config changes)
                $ scanimage -L
                device `pixma:04A9180B_0581C8' is a CANON Canon PIXMA \
                MG3000 Series multi-function peripheral
                $ scanimage --format=jpeg > /tmp/1.jpeg
                $ scanimage --format=jpeg  --resolution 600  > /tmp/2.jpeg

                 sane-frontends eg xscanimage is 14 years old so not built
