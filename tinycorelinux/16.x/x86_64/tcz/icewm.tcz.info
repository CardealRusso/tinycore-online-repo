                Most preferences can change via menu button or context menu. 
                For a RH mouse user context=RH mouse aka button 2
                Please read configs under ~/icewm. TCEs named in keyboard 
                shortcuts have no deps set. On my AMD APU I needed Xorg-7.7 
                (2d or 3d) as a dep. Be aware that IceWM uses this order: 
                prefoverride over theme over preferences
                
                icewmbg can control background or wallpaper(s) Or use pcmanfm 
                for another wallpaper method  https://tinyurl.com/y3ouvb94

                For all changes to a config file, or any TCE added after boot,
                that has a kb combo set.....needs WM refresh with kb combo of
                Alt +z ...Input Alt+z in an empty workspace for maximum safety

                optional TCEs 
                icewm-themes as icewm TCE has only nanoblue 
                icewm-locale & xscreensaver and read their infos please
                menumaker but icewm menu now seems better
                volumeicon  - due to dark panel mouse hover left of net applet RH corner
                ............context menu -> RH mouse for RH mouse users, 
                ............change status icon to white gnome YMMV 
                ............or change theme
                arandr seems better than inbuilt icewm-menu-xrandr     
                
                To allow you to keep wbar, ~/icewm/preferences 
                now reads TaskBarAtTop=1 # 0/1
                
                If you see a locale error in your terminal by running 
                $ icewm -V 
                Paste the following into your .ashrc (change lang to suit)
                export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"  and full reboot.  
                If you use gtk apps read getlocale info please
