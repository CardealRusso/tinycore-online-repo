                Ondemand support removed due to errors seen in $ jwm -p
                On my AMD APU I needed Xorg 2 or 3d
                                                 
                Before making changes, backup target file...make changes then run $ jwm -p 
                If needed, fix -> restart jwm from menu -> re-run $ jwm -p
