Comments:       A tool that can search executables on X 
                or wayland compositors. When active, you type a 
                command and it attempts to launch the highlighted entry 
                when you press the Enter key. Search is exact spelling 
                but not all letters needed.
                Can search pathway $HOME/.local/bin

                Lets type exit gives 2 selections exitcheck.sh and exittc
                If you press the TAB key you are selecting the hightlighted item
                which in example =  exitcheck.sh and exittc disappears
                Therefore avoid using the TAB key.  If you press -> arrow key,
                you can choose to highlight a different selection choice.
                If exitcheck.sh is your target (its already highlighted) 
                press enter. Otherwise type more letters eg exitt...
                to get one selection or use arrow keys to hightlight it.

                If your desktop allows it, create a keyboard  (KB) shortcut
                If you change your mind, or mis-type....press Escape key
                to exit dmenu. While dmenu is active, you can not use KB shortcuts.

                If your search input is for a non-executable (eg) zzz
                you lose all hits and if you forget to Escape and press enter 
                you are launching a missing executable called zzz and will get
                a not found error.

                #################
                On flwm, dmenu may cover any open app that is
                at the top of your monitor. So to close an app,
                you may have to either launch an app or press escape,
                while dmenu active.
                You can safely ignore any msg about
                /home/<name>/.cache/dmenu_run: No such file or directory
                that file is created, after first run is complete
