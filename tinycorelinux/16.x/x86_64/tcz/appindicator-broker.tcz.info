Comments:       ----------
  Notes:
    - this daemon's sole purpose is to StatusNotifierItems
    - SNIs are sometimes called appindicators or systray icons
    - SNIs are supported by various notifications bars (e.g., sfwbar)
  Usage example (from terminal or shell script):
    $ mkfifo /tmp/pipe
    $ export SNI_BROKER=/tmp/pipe
    $ appindicator-broker "$SNI_BROKER" & # this starts the daemon
    $ echo "foo create vlc" > "$SNI_BROKER" # foo=identifier, vlc=icon
    $ echo "foo title some title" > "$SNI_BROKER"
    $ echo "foo label some <b>label</b>" > "$SNI_BROKER"
    $ echo "foo icon /path/to/custom/icon.png" > "$SNI_BROKER"
