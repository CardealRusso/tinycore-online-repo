Comments:       Prometheus, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project,
                is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics
                from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,
                displays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions
                are observed.
                Start with:
                sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/prometheus {start|stop|restart|force-reload|status}
                or
                sudo /usr/local/bin/prometheus --config.file=/usr/local/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
                 --storage.tsdb.path=/usr/local/etc/prometheus/data/

                The database can be saved to a location of choice by configuring the enviroment 
                variable DATA_DIR in /usr/local/etc/prometheus/default/prometheus.
                If not set the default '/usr/local/etc/prometheus/data/' will be used.
                Be aware that unsaved database content will be lost if not backupped
                ('filetool.sh -b') when stored in the default location.
