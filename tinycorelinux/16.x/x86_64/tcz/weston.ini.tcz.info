Comments:       config file will create at   ~/.config/weston.ini
                
                (Upgrade) install script will destroy exiting config file
                so move your current out of ~/.config. This TCE is therefore 
                designed to be run only once, then you make changes to config file
                So do NOT have this in your boot list please.

                There are independent keybindings showing here
                https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Weston#Shortcuts

                Without xwayland loaded, run $ exitcheck.sh reboot (to reboot) 
                or drop reboot to poweroff. All fltk GUIs work without xwayland
                EXCEPT exittc.
                
                Optional TCEs/commands depend on what you need to config
                TCE=xwayland a dep of this TCE but not yet a dep of weston
                TCE=Xorg-7.7-bin allows $ xrandr -q for output settings
                TCE=colord provides files like Bluish.icc
                TCE=sakura reduces broken pipe errors vs weston-terminal YMMV
                
                No sound is setup so TCEs will vary depending on whether you prefer
                alsa (with optional apulse), pulseaudio/pavucontrol*, pipewire and naturally
                read the relevant info files please
